### Hi there, I'm Amarachukwu Finbarrs-Ezema but you can call me Amara!

## I'm a software developer that specializes in Full-Stack Web Applications

- 👑 I'm currently on a journey to become a Ruby on Rails guru
- ✍🏽 I'm currently building projects to add to my portfolio
- 💻 Fun fact: I landed my first software development role in July 2022; although I didn't start until November. Thank God Most High!

## My current role

I am working in the Legal Innovation Lab Wales development team. We primarily use Rails to build web apps that serve as a proof-of-concept. These apps primarily address gaps in the LegalTech sector.
